Windows
1) Open MATLAB
2) Open "Netflux MATLAB Compiler settings Windows.prj"
3) Adjust the text fields, add "Netflux logo.png" as the splash screen
4) All other files are default
5) Select "Package"
6) Get the "Netflux Installation Windows.exe" file from the "for distribution" folder

When the user runs "Netflux Installation Windows.exe", it will do a fairly large download (~700 MB) of the MATLAB Component Runtime, which contains the base functionality of MATLAB.
